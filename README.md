# Shader Assessment - 10/20/23

Created a shader named rainfall and snowfall. These shaders work by updating the texture coordinates of an image on the U and V axis. (X and Y)

The pixel art of the shop was not done by me. Just the 'rain' and 'snow' images. 
By default the scene starts with the daytime version of the image and snowing. 

Left mouse click will disable the snow shader, and enable the rain shader for as long as the button is held down.
Right mouse click will disable the daytime version of the shop and enable the night-time version of the shop as long as the button is held down.

This allows for the player to mix-and-match the weather with the time of day. It can snow during the day or night, as well as rain during the day or night.
